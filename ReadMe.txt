Run Instructions:

    our code runs files based on a range on ints given.
    When you run the program, you should be asked to enter a range
    of the files you'd like to run.

    For example:
        to run files 2 - 8, you need to enter " 2, 8 "
        ro run file 10, you need to enter " 10, 10 "

    Any files not in the KnapsackTestData file cannot be ran, adding new files is
    fine as long as they have the same format --  pNUMBER_CHAR.txt
